# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle Population dataset to understand the trends and characteristics of electric vehicles.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv`. It contains information about battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) registered in Washington state.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed in the `e_car_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. The notebook covers the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The dataset is loaded and cleaned to handle missing values.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of electric vehicles, top manufacturers, popular models, and trends over the years.
3.  **Machine Learning Model:** A machine learning model is built to predict the electric vehicle type (BEV or PHEV) based on the vehicle's features.

## Setup

To run the analysis, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Then, you can open and run the `e_car_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
